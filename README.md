This is an EdTech platform. Here, anyone can sign up as a Student or an Instructor.

Catagories are being set prior by Admin only.

Instructors can add courses under a particular category and upload video lectures topic-wise. They will have a seperate dashboard where they can check all details and statistics about their own courses i.e how many students are enrolled in that course or what's the total earnings etc.

Courses will be available in the Catalog section under their respective catagories.

Students can go to the Catalog section and add any course to cart and buy it. After successful payment, the course will be available in the enrolled courses section of the student dashboard. From there student can open the video lectures and watch the videos and progress of videos will also be saved. Besides, enrolled students can also give rating and reviews to that course.

Payment will be done through Razorpay gateway where multiple ways of payment are present.

Both student and instructor can view, edit and save their profiles and upload profile picture in Settings and if required can also delete their account.

There is no admin signup process till now, working on that.
